# Copilot Instructions for This Codebase

## Overview
This repository currently contains a single Python file: `Övn2.py`. The codebase appears to be in an early or experimental stage, with a class definition for `Fordon` (Swedish for "Vehicle").

## Key Patterns and Conventions
- **Language:** Python
- **File Naming:** Uses Swedish characters (e.g., `Övn2.py`).
- **Class Naming:** Classes use PascalCase (e.g., `Fordon`).
- **Parameter Naming:** Parameters are in Swedish (e.g., `märke`, `modell`).

## Project Structure
- `Övn2.py`: Main (and only) source file. Contains class definitions. No clear module or package structure yet.
- No test files, build scripts, or external dependencies are present.

## Developer Workflows
- **Editing:** Directly edit `Övn2.py` to add or modify classes and logic.
- **Execution:** Run the file using Python 3.x:
  ```powershell
  python .\Övn2.py
  ```
- **No automated tests or build steps** are defined at this stage.

## Special Notes
- **Swedish Language:** Variable and class names are in Swedish. Maintain this convention for consistency.
- **No external dependencies** or frameworks are used.
- **No existing AI agent instructions** or project-specific rules were found in the repository.

## Example Pattern
```python
class Fordon:
    def __init__(self, märke, modell):
        self.märke = märke
        self.modell = modell
```

## Guidance for AI Agents
- Use Swedish for all new class, method, and variable names.
- Follow Python best practices for class and method structure.
- If expanding the codebase, keep all new code in `Övn2.py` unless instructed otherwise.
- Document new classes and methods with concise docstrings (in Swedish if possible).
